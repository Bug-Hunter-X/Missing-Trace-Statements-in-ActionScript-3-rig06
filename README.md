# Missing Trace Statements in ActionScript 3

This repository demonstrates a common issue in ActionScript 3 where `trace` statements fail to appear in the output panel.  The bug occurs due to the combination of specific circumstances, potentially related to how the application is run or configured. This example shows the problem and the proposed solution.

## Bug Report

The `trace` statements within the `myFunction` function are intended to output text to the output panel. In this particular scenario, those statements are not appearing correctly. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the correct output settings for the ActionScript 3 runtime. Check the output panel's settings. Also, verify that the application is running in a context where `trace` statements are supported and active. In certain environments or build processes, output redirection or configurations might suppress these outputs. Consider using a more robust logging system if needed for production environments.
